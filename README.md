# Frontend challenge

## Solution Improvement

* One of the things that I considered an improvement was move all logic from components, keeping them cleaner, easier to mantain and to test.
* Some variables name was changed to better reflect what is used for. For example: `mapArray` was changed to `mapTeamMembersToList`.
* Created unit tests to cover almost all scenarios, like `events`, `data rendering` and `navigation`.
Separeted some code by context, for example types and api, to keep code organized.

## Instructions

* Create new components that will be simple and stateless as possible.
* Any logic should be kept in pages or any state management library.
* Cover as much scenarios as possibles with unit tests.
* Create variables that shows what this is used for.
